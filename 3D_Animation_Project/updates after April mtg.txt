Updates from Terran after 4/23 meeting

I’ve talked to my colleagues about parts of the animation, and I have some feedback that should make our job easier.

We do not need the little “shuttling blobs” that move the electrons from one big blob to the next.

We do not need to have a cell membrane texture to the membranes of the mitochondria.

We do not need to show the H+ protons moving through the middle of the electron transport enzymes (blobs) or ATP synthase. We all agreed that having the protons simply pass in front of the enzyme shape should be sufficient to help students get the right idea.

Lastly, they requested an image or animation of the mitochondria where the viewers perspective goes from viewing a mitochondrion in a cell, then zooms in to show all the membrane folds inside containing multiple electron transport chains. This could be a separate animation and we could work on this once the other parts are finished.

 

I’d be happy to meet again to discuss any of these ideas. Thank you for working on this with me!
