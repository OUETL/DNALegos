# DNALegos

The DNA Legos project is along with Dr. Tarren Shaw from the Biology Department and this is a course integration with his BIOL1124 Lab.

DNA Replication is a basic biological process that has a lot of moving parts.
Dr. Shaw wanted his students to be able to have a tactile example of a process that is difficult to imagine. 
His rough sketches of the DNA enzymes were turned into 3D models that were 3D printed. 
There are 3 enzymes: helicase, DNA polymerase, and ligase that work along with PLUS PLUS pieces (which are used to represent DNA strands).
These 3D printed pieces were already used in his laboratory course. 
The feedback from his students was very positive on how the 3D printed enzymes helped them to better understand the material.

The current versions of each enzyme being used are: Helicase 0.4.stl; Polymerase 1.3.3mf; and Ligase 0.1.stl.
